## Version 1.4 `08 Jan 2024`

### Features

- New renderer with progressive enhancement for utilizing of OffscreenCanvas in a worker thread
- Shader parsing is moved to a worker thread as well
- Added manual shader recompilation

### ⚠️ Issues ⚠️

Large shaders may take long to recompile and since the GPU resources are not properly shared between main and worker threads there will still be a UI freeze.

To eliminate this issue you need to **disable** `"Hardware Acceleration"` in settings of your browser. Alternatively opt into manual recompilation.

### Changes

- Textures now have mipmaps generated by default, so you can use `textureLod()` to sample the levels

## Version 1.3 `07 Aug 2023`

### Features

- Now users can add up to 16 local textures (supports images and videos) to use inside of shaders. Just drag'n'drop a file (or multiple files at once) into editor view. Alternatively click texture slot and choose a file in a dialog
